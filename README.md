# Windows 10 Demo King
A windows 10 app to demonstrate some of the new features and APIs of Windows 10. 
Right now this application is not exactly beautiful, but that's not the point of this app. 
The idea of this app is to demonstrate some of the APIs with as few lines of code as possible. So
don't expect exception handling here. It's rather an attempt to answer questions like  "How Do I call this API?" .



# How do I use this?
1. Download it, open the Solution in VS 2015.
2. Run the W10Demoking App. Hidden in the Splitview you will find several scenarios. Every scenario is implemented in a separate page. The matching of scenarios and page names should be pretty easy to do and should be self-explaining. 
3. Try everything out. There are scenarios that don't work out of the box. That's when you need a second app. You will find the second app(s) in the solution hidden in separate folders. (For Launch Results, App Services, Drag&Drop)
Make sure you start these Apps once, to register correctly on the system.

Have fun with it mod it fork it ... but keep it simple.
